# LaserWarnMK1
Alarm/E-Stop system for the Laser Cutter at Milton Keynes Makerspace when no cooler flow is detected. This version uses an Arduino Nano with an external relay board and a buzzer. Future versions will add extra functionaility such as access control, monitoring and logging and other functions to the laser cutter using ESP32 or similar.
